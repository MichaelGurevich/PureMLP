Neural Network from Scratch in C++ for MNIST Digit Recognition

This project features a fully custom implementation of a Neural Network built entirely from scratch in C++, with no reliance on external machine learning libraries or frameworks. Its goal is to accurately classify handwritten digits from the well-known MNIST dataset.

Project Highlights

Pure C++ Implementation: No external ML libraries; all components (layers, neurons, activations, training, and inference) coded from scratch.

Handwritten Digit Classification: Trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset, achieving high accuracy.

Interactive GUI Application: Includes an intuitive user interface allowing users to draw digits and receive instant predictions from the neural network.
